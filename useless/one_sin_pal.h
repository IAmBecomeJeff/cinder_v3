 * all_freq - What is the frequency
 * bg_bri - The background brightness
 * bg_clr - The background colour
 * start_index  - What foreground colour are we starting with?
 * this_bright - How bright is it?
 * this_cutoff - If the brightness is lower than this_, then brightness=0
 * this_inc - incrementer to change the starting colour after each pass
 * this_index - rotating colours down the strip counter
 * this_phase - the counter used in conjunction with the frequency to move down the strip
 * this_rot - How quickly to rotate those colours down the strip
 * this_speed  - How fast does it whip down the strand
